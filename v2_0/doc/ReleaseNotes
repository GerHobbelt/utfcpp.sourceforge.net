utf8 cpp library
Release 2.0 Beta 1

This is the first Beta release of the version 2.0 of the library. Please note that the branch 1.x is still being developed, and will be maintained even after 2.x becomes stable.

Changes from version 1.02:

- Feature request [1569543]: Add utf8 iterator adapter class
- Feature request [1569479]: Add replace_invalid function
- Reorganized the source code: rather than a single header file, the library now resides in three separate ones. To maintain the backward compatibility, there is also a convenience header utf8.h that includes all the other ones.
- The requironment for octet_iterator is bidirectional, rather than random access, although in practice it probably doesn't mean a lot.

Files included in the release: utf8.h, core.h, checked.h, unchecked.h, utf8cpp.html, ReleaseNotes
